## Introduction
This document indicates how to participate in this project, how to submit contributions and how to make changes.

## Make a commit
Each commit must be associated with a github issue. The submitted code must be commented and tested.


## Branch Management
  ### Branch organization
  Our branches are organized as follows: 
  * a `master` branch for renderings
  * a `develop` branch, stable and tested for the next rendering
  * a `newfeaturename` branch to develop new features
  
  ### Add a branch
  Use the following command to create a new branch : 
  
  ```
  git checkout -b mynewbranchname
  ```
  
  To switch to another branch : 
  
  ```
  git checkout otherbranch
  ```
 
  
  ### Create a pull request
  Go to Git and click on `Compare & pull request`.
  
  Add a title and description to the pull request.
  
  The submitted code must be clear, commented and tested for the pull request to be accepted.
  
  Then use the `merge` command to merge the branches.

  The pull request is mandatory before performing a merge on Master.
